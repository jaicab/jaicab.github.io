Ever since designers entered the web field, there’s been a continuous discussion between design and development. Each discipline favours their preferences. And when responsive design became a standard, this separation became greater.

Many designers couldn’t adapt to this change due to legacy thinking, and started to create fixed comps for “mobile” and “desktop” screen sizes, leaving front-end developers up to the task to fill in everything in between.

This lead to designers not being happy about the design of the in-betweens and front-end developers overwhelmed with responsibility. Therefore, developers started asking designers to learn how to code in order to ensure the design was respected by doing it themselves. 

But it is not that common to see this happening the other way around, developers getting into design. Probably because developers usually tend to be more pragmatic, they just want _make it work_, and care less about how it looks. 

Those who understand code from a design perspective, know about basic user experience like readability and responsive patterns, but don’t necessarily spend their time writing JavaScript for “web apps” or designing logos or illustrations are **front-end designers**.
