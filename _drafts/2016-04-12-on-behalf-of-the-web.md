Mark goes out and buys the latest iPhone. He buys it because it has all the nicest features and uses all the latest technologies. Mark is very happy with his decision --- <q>this phone will last me for years</q> --- he thought.

Then time passes. Apple presents a new iPhone. Mark doesn't keep track of tech events so he doesn't hear about it until a few days later, when a colleage tells him. Up to that instant, Mark was as happy as he could ever be with his device. But now his iPhone didn't feel as great anymore. 

A portable window to mankind's knowledge that is at least [120 million times](https://www.quora.com/How-much-more-computing-power-does-an-iPhone-6-have-than-Apollo-11-What-is-another-modern-object-I-can-relate-the-same-computing-power-to/answer/Paul-Ledak) as powerful as the computer that took mankind to the Moon. And now it's crap. Mark _needs_ to get the new one. Isn't that amazing. 



We tend to want new things. We're driven by the excitement of _the next now_. Social influence and marketing campaigns make the _now_, become _past_ (and by past I mean everything up to that minute), up to the point it looks like _then_. From this point forwards, the _now_ will look like the **new now**! 



These solutions try to turn the table around, creating solutions to problems that only exist on their own understanding of the _correct_ model of the Web. New ideas, like mobile apps

 to go against the grain.

For as long as I can remember, developers have been complaining about the capabilities of the Web. I've seen smart people creating over-engineered solutions to force square pegs in round holes.
