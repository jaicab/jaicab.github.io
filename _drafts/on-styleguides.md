Last week, I attended Smashing Conference on beautiful Whistler, Canada. Now there were two common themes throughout the conference and those were performance and style guides. Today, I want to focus on style guides. 

It's no big news that style guides are good. Anybody who had worked with a big organization probably had to deal with one. Usually, a 300-page PDF with all the colors they use, the spacing for the different logos and the appropriate context for the brand. 

But that's not enough for the web. A web developer builds **unpredictable** elements, modules and layouts. Uses HEX/rgb colors —which result varies from screen to screen— and not Pantone. Fluid, responsive units and not fixed, pixel-perfect blocks. 

So we need to start thinking in building developer-oriented style guides, like the ones we've already seen:
- Starbucks. 
- Code for America.
