While in college, I had the opportunity to work as a web developer for <abbr title="Grupo Alianza Norte">GANOR</abbr> (which means North Alliance Group), a company who managed up to 20 engineering companies, like construction, architecture, design and material manufacturers, making them work together.

I was in charge of the maintenance of the sites of the multiple companies and the contruction of a single site as a showcase of all the projects they had built all over the world.

##Responsibilities

- Design and rasionalisation
- UI development
	- Architecture
	- Object oriented style guide
- PHP development
	- MVC content
	- Blog-like news section
	- Projects showcase
- JS development
	- Custom Google Maps integration
	- fancyBox-like photo galleries
- Scalable MySQL schema and implementation
- Maintenance of the other sites

##Results

The site is [up and running](http://ganor.es) so you can check it out. I left them with the following:

- An object oriented **style guide** in HTML and LESS.
- A powerful, totally scalable **MVC PHP** system.
- A fully integrated **custom Google Maps** for the projects.


##The process
I'll never forget the time I met Manuel, the managing director of GANOR. He wanted a site where they could share documents privately. He was amazed when I introduced him to **Dropbox** and set it up for all the managers of the group.

Once that was finished, we got to the main part, the projects. He wanted to manage the projects, upload photos of them and see them on a world-wide map where he could click and see the project. And that's what I did.

I used Google Maps for the map, fancyBox for the gallery and PHP for the rest. Now you can upload pictures, select a profile picture to use as a thumbnail, and create, edit and delete projects. You can also publish news in the blog-like news section, manage the "what we do" section and the contact data.


##Curiosities
- Geocoding an address is the most time-consuming task you can do with Google Maps API. Save the coordinates in a database.
- By floating the contact form, you can expand the textarea and the design still fits.

##Summary

It took me **29 days** to complete the site and multiple changes I was asked for. Since it was the first time I played with Google Maps this further, I learned a lot about how it works.
