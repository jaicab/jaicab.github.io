Hi, I'm Jaime. I am a **front-end architect** from Spain. This means I care about quality of both **design** and **development**. I study, mock-up and put in place fast mobile-first **responsive** designs. 

I'm into **progressive enhancement**, so content and performance go always first for me.
I enjoy creating pixel-perfect, scalable and maintainable CSS code. I apply **OOCSS**, **SMACSS**, **BEM** and **DRY CSS** techniques.

I <a href="/">write</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/{{site.twitter}}">tweet</a>, <a href="http://github.com/{{ site.username }}">share code</a> and <a href="http://codepen.io/{{ site.username }}">do experiments</a> about CSS and the latest, cutting edge technologies for the web.

##Language skills

I enjoy learning about new cultures. That's why I'm studying **Mandarin**. Also because **one sixth of world population** speak it and that's a lot of people I can't talk with if they don't speak English.

##Technical skills

I write code with [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), commit wia **git** and deploy using [Transit](http://panic.com/transmit/).
I play with the design in [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and iPad's app [Paper by 53](https://www.fiftythree.com/paper).
I have a forgetful mind but an agile heart, so I organize my work on [Redbooth](https://redbooth.com/) (previously Teambox).

###Preprocessors
I save time and power up CSS and JavaScript by using **Sass** and sometimes **CoffeScript**. I can't stop coding till everything is an object with perfect, proportional margins and ratios and also the lightest possible.
I'm driven by the **80/20 rule**, which says that 80% of the design can be accomplished by 20% of the code.

That means **no CSS frameworks**! They add up weight, unwanted styles and dependecies which take tons of wasted time to remove. I believe that what makes a good front-end is not getting good results with frameworks but getting even better ones without them.

###MVC frameworks
> "MVC. Maybe Viewable Content." - Scott Jehl

Even though I've developed some applications and [open source experiments](https://github.com/jaicab/ciego.es) in AngularJS, **I don't like MVC JavaScript frameworks** because they don't work with **progressive enhancement**. If the framework fails, you get no content at all.

I prefer light core JavaScript that you can apply so it enhances the experience but not depends on it, like I did with [Paraxify.js](https://github.com/jaicab/Paraxify.js).

##UI/UX design skills

>"When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive." - James Gleick

When you focus on content, you get the inherent UI. In a world where information is cheap, content must be first. A clean, straight-forward markup makes you website SEO friendly and also designer friendly.

I like to say that __if you get the essence of the experience, then the interface comes by itself__.

I've set up a **workflow** that works like CSS, in cascade. The information grows exponentially:

1. Sketch up the info given.
2. Break it down to pieces.
3. Do a simple HTML (no CSS, no JS) mock-up spreading the content.
4. List the separate user experiences you have come up with.
5. Get them working on a black and white mock-up.
6. List all the UI objects and design them mobile-first.
7. Back-end time. Keep JS dependencies to a minimum.
8. Enhance the experience with JavaScript, if needed.
9. Re-check dependecies, merge, gzip'em and get them into versioned cache.
10. Test, test, test and deploy.

It's also important that these experiences work beautifully across as many devices as possible. I love my device lab and mocking up on all of my devices at the same time using **CodeKit**'s live reload and style injection.
