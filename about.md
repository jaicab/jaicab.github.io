I aim to create websites that make users, clients and teams happy. True care for quality and web standards is what always has motivated me, so I approach work through _progressive enhancement_.

My personal goal is to satisfy the web's ubiquity.

### Design and development



## Technical skills

I have been working in London over a year, during which I have perfected many of my skills. This is what I'm good at.

- Deep understanding of OOCSS.
- Strong experience with responsive design, grid systems, and media queries.
- Experience with building styleguides.
- Attention to detail, and appreciation for clean, pragmatic, and reusable code.
- Deep understanding of Web Standards.
- Deep understanding of performance when it comes to your code.
- Strong knowledge of cross-browser and cross-device quirks along with knowing how to debug each browser and device.
- Experience with building large scale websites.
- Able to work in an agile and fast paces environment.
- Able to work extremely close with the design team.
- Passionate for learning new technologies and collaborating with a team.

I have vast experience using Sass, having built some cool libraries now used by some big companies, like:

- [sass-vary](https://github.com/jaicab/sass-vary): vary is the most powerful theming solution for Sass available. Simple as that. Also, easy to use.
- [sass-ext](https://github.com/jaicab/sass-ext): ext gives you control over the @extend directive in Sass, allowing you to set selector budgets.

Another of my strong skills is web performance, some examples are:

- [localFont](https://github.com/jaicab/localFont): localFont is an online tool to implement localStorage web font caching in seconds. Using pure JS, this tool encodes your font files on base64 strings and puts them on a font face declaration. Then this CSS will be saved in a file that will be loaded asynchronously into localStorage. This solution is currently used by Smashing Magazine.
- [Making a difference with performance](http://jaicab.com/2015/05/18/making-a-difference-with-performance/): This is a case study on how I tried to achieve absolute perfection in web performance for Base Creative's website, comparing it against its competitors.

But essentially, what I'm proud of is making robust experiences, so all my skills and even my mindset could be summarised by Postel's law:

> "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal on what you accept from others" - [Jon Postel](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-12)

In terms of tools, I use a grunt-based engine that I developed at Base Creative called [barebase](https://github.com/basecreative/barebase). It's so powerful it allows the development of a flat build as well as production build using the same codebase for common elements.

### MVC frameworks
> "MVC. Maybe Viewable Content." - Scott Jehl

Even though I've developed some applications and [open source experiments](https://github.com/jaicab/ciego.es) in AngularJS, **I don't like MVC JavaScript frameworks** because they don't work with **progressive enhancement**. If the framework fails, you get no content at all.

I prefer light core JavaScript that you can apply so it enhances the experience but not depends on it, like I did with [Paraxify.js](https://github.com/jaicab/Paraxify.js).


## UI/UX design skills

>"When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive." - James Gleick

When you focus on content, you get the inherent UI. In a world where information is cheap, content must be first. A clean, straight-forward markup makes you website SEO friendly and also designer friendly.

I have a very good understanding of the designer's worries and can establish a continous conversation so we make each other's lifes easier. There's no need for a compromise when we can all be happy. I'm very good at finding that solution.


## Language skills

I enjoy learning about new cultures. That's why I'm studying **Mandarin**. Also because **one sixth of world population** speak it and that's a lot of people I can't talk with if they don't speak English.
