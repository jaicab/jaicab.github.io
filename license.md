This site's code and its content is totally open source, as every other site on the web should be. **Go crazy.**

If you want to copy an article and publish it as yours without crediting me, that's kinda rude. But I'm not gonna spend time ranting all over you on the internet about it. I'd rather go for a few drinks with some friends.

This license has been inspired by CSSTricks' [Super Important Legal Document](http://css-tricks.com/license/).
