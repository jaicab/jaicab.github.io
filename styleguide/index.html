      <p>This site has a small style guide (or more precisely, pattern library) due to a focus on reusable components. The patterns have been grouped by scope, making it easy to understand where to use each.</p>


      <h2>The <code>.s-text</code> scope</h2>
      <p>Represents an area of user-generated content, where the HTML comes from a CMS. It will set some cross-screen typography styles. It will also privde styles for some classless components for an efortless styling experience.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="s-text">
      <h2>Global scope</h2>
      <p>Here patterns inherit the default properties from the root element. Besides its own styles, patterns here will only be afected by the resets and some basic generic styles like font family and size.</p>
    </div>
