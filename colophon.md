<p class="c-intro">This site is built using a number of third party tools and services.</p>

This website is produce on an [Apple Mac](http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook/), designed and built on and for the browser while coded using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

Published using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), managed through [GitHub](https://github.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), while [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) acts as CDN, protection and caching optimisation.

Font files are delivered (when necessary) from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). Type used:

- [Circular](https://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular/) by Laurenz Brunner
- [Montserrat](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat) by Julieta Ulanovsky
- [Crimson Text](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Crimson+Text) by Sebastian Kosch

Some assets are preprocessed with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) tasks to optimise and compress assets in ways not possible using CloudFlare nor Jekyll.

There's an offline version working on those browsers that support [Service Workers](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/blob/master/explainer.md). The more pages you visit, the more that will be cached. You can see what's being cached under Service Workers in Chrome Developer Tools.
