<p class="c-intro c-intro--color">Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Jaime Caballero</strong>, a <a href="/work/">frontend architect</a>, <a href="/articles/">writer</a> and film buff based in London, UK. I work as a nexus between design and frontend, making purposeful websites scalable and lightning-fast.</p>

<p class="c-intro c-intro--color">
I like to build useful <a href="/projects/">side projects</a> in my spare time, either to improve my skills or my workflow.

<p class="c-intro c-intro--color">
I'm interested in design systems, cinema, languages, philosophy and traditional crafts, like the japanese <a href="https://youtu.be/lT55_u8URU0"><em>kintsugi</em></a>.
