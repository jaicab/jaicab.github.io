<p class="c-intro c-intro--color" id="skip" tabindex="-1">Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Jaime Caballero</strong>, a <a href="/about/">frontend designer</a>, film buff and <a href="http://instagram.com/jai_cab">digital nomad</a> currently based in Tokyo, Japan. I work as a nexus between design and frontend, <a href="/work/">making websites</a> scalable and lightning-fast.</p>

<p class="c-intro c-intro--color">
I like to build useful <a href="/projects/">side projects</a> in my spare time, to improve either my skills or my workflow.
</p>

<p class="c-intro c-intro--color">
I'm interested in design systems, cinema, languages, philosophy and traditional crafts, like the japanese <a href="https://youtu.be/lT55_u8URU0"><em>kintsugi</em></a>.
